- [x] commits pane overhaul
  - [x] Better graph view (enabled by default)
  - [x] Filter by branch
  - [x] Filter by commit message (handy if you prefix with ticket IDs)
- [x] ~Command palette (OpenCode-style) — still figuring this one out~ - It's `?`

- [x] Stash viewer:
  - Can we add the same viewer for files in the '[5] Stash' sidebar tab? (the same way we currently do with Commits tab)
- [x] Enter key in the branches sidebar tab.
  - When I press 'enter' here, it shows the 'Commits (<branch>)'. Then when I press 'enter' again it shows the 'Commit Files' (kinda similar to the [4] commits sidebar tab)
- [x] Commit item focus, what does the diff preview look like? Currently it's just plain (which kinda makes sense because there could be multiple of files in 1 commit) Expected: A nice viewer wherein I can still see the syntax highlighting, just as nice as hovering on a single file. I wonder if we can still use similar for this.
- [x] A 'Help' sort of 'which-key' feature thingy, pressing `?` would open a dialog that shows me which keys I can press in the current context. Make it also searchable i.e. pressing `/` would highlight the specific hotkey I'm looking for. Very similar to the original lazygit, just make it look better because I actually didn't like the original. i.e. The search looked too disconnected from the dialog.
- [x] Like \_tmp_lumen, I want to be able to highlight lines on the diff exploration viewing mode with my mouse.. Highlighting something would also show the same `y copy esc` tooltip just under the highlight. (no annotate since that's a lumen concept)
- [x] Like \_tmp_lumen, I want to `{}` to travel between hunks. I want `[]` to show 'old' or 'new' (so it toggle hides the side-by-side). Make sure the `[]` doesn't break the mouse interactions for highlights. I want to show the `?` help panel while focusing the 'main content diff content exploration focus' so I can see these hotkeys.
- [x] Like the original lazygit, let's have a subtab under [4] Commits, for Reflog.

- [x] More feature-parity stuff with the original lazygit... Missing features from the original lazygit (from my investigation, but I could be missing more, so add more here)
  - [x] In 'Remotes', I press `n`, prolly not implemented.
  - [x] In 'Remotes', I press `d` (delete), prolly not implemented.
  - [x] In 'Tags', I press `g` (reset), prolly not implemented.
    - [x] I noticed in the original lazygit, in the reset menu options, I see the associated command w/ it i.e.
    - Mixed reset reset --mixed f115cxxx (the 'reset --mixed f115cxxx' has a different color.)
    - Soft reset reset --soft f115cxxx
    - Hard reset reset --hard f115cxxx
  - [x] In 'Tags', I press `P`, to push tags? prolly not implemeanted.
  - [x] contextual `?` for some other pages that we haven't considered before.
    - [x] I press `?` on Remotes, I don't see much.
    - [x] I press `?` on Tags, I don't see much.
    - [x] I press `?` on Worktrees, I don't see much. It still says 'Files'
    - [x] I press `?` on Submodules, I don't see much. It still says 'Files'
  - [x] In Tags, in the original lazygit, I can:
    - [x] Press enter and see a 'commits list view'?
    - [x] after in the 'commits list view', I can press enter again and see the 'commit files' view.
    - [x] after in the 'commit files' view, I can press enter to go into 'diff exploration' (if you notice this is pretty much all standard at this point)
  - [x] In Reflog, in the original lazygit, I can:
    - [x] Press enter and it goes into 'commits list view', then if I press enter it goes into 'commit files' view, and enter again goes to 'diff exploration' (pretty standard again)
  - [x] In 'commits list view', I can press `o` to open commit in the browser.
    - Let's make this a bit different for lazygitrs. Same idea with the 'Branches' `o` key. It opens a popup for 'Open in browser' with a list of stuff I can open about this commit. So I guess 1 option is just the 'Open commit url'
    - Actually now that I realize.. We already have a `y` option for Commit url, so that's very good.
  - [x] In 'Commits list view', pressing `y` opens the 'Copy to clipboard'. Minor issue/changes:
    - [x] In the original lazygit, sometimes 'commit message body' is strikethrough'd Maybe because if it doesnt exist?
    - [x] In the original lazygit, sometimes 'commit tags' is strikethrough'd Maybe because it doesnt exist?

- [ ] For the feature-parity stuff I didn't consider in the previous todo, write it here (For AI):
  - Interactive Rebase / Commit Manipulation:
    - [ ] In 'Commits', I press `d` to drop the selected commit. Currently unimplemented.
    - [ ] Cherry-pick paste (`V`) — we have cherry-pick copy (`C`) in Commits, but no paste action to apply copied commits onto current branch.
    - [ ] In 'Commits', the original lazygit has `<c-r>` to reset cherry-pick selection.
    - [ ] Undo/Redo — the original lazygit has `z`/`<c-z>` to undo and redo git actions (using reflog under the hood).
  - Conflict Resolution:
    - [ ] Merge conflict resolution UI — the original lazygit lets you pick between versions when a merge/rebase results in conflicts.
    - [ ] Rebase conflict resolution UI — similar conflict resolution flow during interactive rebase.
    - [ ] In 'Files', the original lazygit has `M` to open merge tool / external merge tool for resolving conflicts.
  - Files:
    - [x] In 'Files', the original lazygit has `e` to open file in editor and `o` to open file in default program.
    - [x] In 'Files', the original lazygit has `<c-o>` to copy the diff of the selected file to clipboard (we have this in `y` menu, but the direct shortcut may be missing).
    - [ ] Full `$EDITOR` integration — committing with `C` (editor mode) currently has a limitation where it can't suspend the TUI to open a real terminal editor.
  - Remotes:
    - [x] In 'Remotes', pressing `Enter` should drill into remote branches. Then from a remote branch: `<space>` to checkout, `M` to merge, `r` to rebase onto it, `d` to delete remote branch.
  - Submodules:
    - [x] In 'Submodules', the original lazygit has more operations: `a` to add submodule, `d` to remove submodule, `e` to enter submodule (open a nested lazygit in that submodule), `<space>` to update submodule.
  - Worktrees:
    - [x] In 'Worktrees', the original lazygit has `<space>` to switch to worktree (open it).
  - Branches:
    - [x] In 'Branches', the original lazygit shows divergence info (ahead/behind counts relative to upstream). (already implemented)
  - Done / Won't Do:
    - [x] ~Diff mode — the original lazygit has a way to diff any two commits/branches against each other (not just viewing a single commit's diff).~ (Author check: I have separate ideas for diff mode: comapring two commits/branches against each other, it'll be more intuitive)
    - [x] ~In 'Branches', the original lazygit has `<c-o>` to copy PR URL, we might already have this in the `y` menu but worth verifying the direct shortcut.~ (Author check: so yeah we won't need this)

- [x] Improve the speeds still, very important for larger repos. Improve first-load speed. Either cache the data, or the render the TUI even before the git load model data isn't there yet. (perceived speed)
- [x] regular push behavior to essentially do `git push origin HEAD`

- [ ] Config-parity, make sure everything works.
- [ ] Hot reloading of config (I can edit the config on the fly and the config is still read without restarting lazygit)
- [x] Bug: in the diff exploration view, because of the 10s interval I think the position of which I scrolled at also seems to get reset. Ideally not. Just like how the [new] and [old] -- it used to have this bug but I fixed it.
- [x] Search feature inside the diff exploration view is much needed.
- [ ] Future: Grep for all in diff_mode is good too.
- [x] Search feature inside of diff mode. It works in the default view.
- [x] In `?` help dialog, use tui-textarea so I can erase the input using opt-backspace.
- [x] In 'Commit Files' view, in any, when I press `y`, it opens a Copy to clipboard dialog (same with other features). Some options I will see are: 'Copy filename', 'Copy old content', 'Copy new content'.

## Stuff I wanna do differently

- [x] Interactive Rebase should be more intuitive.
  - [x] I can see a commits list and then also see the commit it'll be merging into. Kinda exactly like VSCode's interactive rebase editor. https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/641685/102309169-31ba2a00-3f36-11eb-8b26-050c7d83fa3f.png but in TUI version. This could be a dialog on its own with its own focus groups. It'll look simpler and more interactive than the current lazygit.
    - Non-negotiables for me are:
      - I can press jk up down to switch between commits. I can h l left right to change the value to pick, squash, drop, edit.
      - The pick, drop, edit, squash options have semantic colors. The same w/ VSCode.
      - The node-like colors w/ indicators on the left side are great to have.
      - I can SEE the commit it'll rebase ontop of i.e. 'Hello GitLens' in this example.
      - I can see a 'Start Rebase' and an 'Abort' action.
- [x] Diff Mode / Compare Mode
  - Diff mode can be opened w/ a commad palette or when focusing on either BRANCH or COMMITS tab.
  - First trigger of it opening will open its own sort of screen that looks like:

    ```
    -------------------------------------------------------
    | A: ccf0183  | B: 09s8c90 |                          |
    ---------------------------- diff exploration view    |
    | Commit Files             |                          |
    |                          |                          |
    |                          |                          |
    |                          |                          |
    -------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    - So there's like an A and B comboboxes there. They can help you autosearch for a commit or a branch.
    -
    - You can obviously exit and go back to the default lazygit UI.
    - You can press tab to cycle focus between the A and B comboboxes, Commit Fles, and diff exploration view.
    - Commit Files and Diff Exploration View actually already exist if you notice. So as expected, they'd have the same hotkeys sort of. Especially diff exploration view like `[]` `{}`.

- [x] Pressing up or down in the commit messages, should cycle through previously submitted ones. Kinda like the up or down key in the commandline.
- [x] In '3 Branches' git checkout -.
- [x] In '3 Branches' git checkout by name. Pressing 'c'
- [x] In '3 Branches'. pressing d, opens a 'Delete branch ?' dialog, and I can see options:
  - c Delete local branch
  - r Delete remote branch
  - b Delete local and remote branch
  - And when I press 'c' to delete local branch, it asks me, 'branch' is not fully merged. Are you sure you want to delete it?
  - It also seems to be aware of the remote options so it strikethroughs if the remote is not there.. And the delete local and remote one.
- [x] In 'Files' when File Tree view is toggled on, in the original lazygit, there's a ▼ at the very root. I want that for our Files and Commit Files too.
- [x] In 'Files' show the diff for folders. We already have this for 'Commits' it shows a multifile diff preview.
- [x] In 'Files', pressing `i` shows a dialog, right now it immediately applies it.
- [x] In 'Branches', whichever is the 'checked-out' branch. Put it at the first of the list.

- [x] Diff view textwrapping.
- [x] Pressing 'e' to edit.
- [x] Pressing 'e' to edit w/ 'column'
- [x] Persist the ` file tree view setting.
- [x] Emit config commands in the 'Command Log'
- [x] Diff hunks now have offsetted line numbers.

- [x] Theming, like opencode style!

- [x] Make the combobox work with mouse (in diff_mode)
- [x] In diff_mode, show the 'current branch' as the first option.
- [x] ~In 'Commits' view, pressing 'd' to drop a commit.~ Just recommend using 'g' maybe?

- [x] Improve and standardize list-view mouse interaction behaviors:
  - Keyboard
    - Pressing down, Only start scrolling down when selected/cursor is on the last viewable element (I think this behavior is already behaved by all)
    - Pressing up, Only start scrolling up when the selected/cursor is already on the first viewable element (not followed by '2 Files', '3 Branches', '4 Commits', '5 Stash' etc. - currently even if I'm on the last element, it will still scroll up when I press up)
  - Mouse
    - Clicking a list item - just essentially skips cursor to select the item as the new selected/cursor. Shouldn't really imitate 'enter', it just changes the selection. Currently works in '2 Files' tab. i.e. 'Keybindings' (?), Interactive rebase (I), Checkout (c on branches), Color Theme.
    - Scroll down - should have the same behavior as pressing down on any of the cmdk-style components
    - Scroll up - should have the same behavior as pressing up.
    - [x] In shift- or shift+ (meaning the sizebar is in the only view...), mouse scroll does not work for the list views i.e. Commits, Branches, etc.
    - [x] New change, scrolling up/down with mouse isn't same behavior as pressing down or up. It just scrolls, but doesn't change the current selection. Let's do this!

- [x] Subtab and sub-item menu mouse clicks should work, right now in sidebar, if I go to Branches, find main, press enter (now in commit files), I use my mouse and it goes back to 'Branches'. Maybe because mouseclicks currently on the sidebar usually always register for the root sub-item tab.

- [x] Loading state in 'actions' for dialogs i.e. Copy PR URL (just freezes the screen while it does the fetch call..., can we maybe add a loading without creating a separate dialog for it, just sort of a loading icon next to it when it's running). Some I can note of:
  - Copy PR URL
  - Open PR URL
  - Generate AI Commit Message (might be good, but honestly, I already liked what I did with it, so don't touch that.)

- [x] In 'remote branches' improvements and parity.
  - Just like in local branches, you always see the 'current branch' as the first item. Now here, we should be able to see that the first branch is the current branch item you see is the remote version of the current branch, if possible.
  - Currently in remote branches subtab, I can see the remotes connected to this repo... I can press 'enter' to see the branches, after that I can't really press 'enter' on any item on there anymore. Desired: I should be able to press 'enter' to subview visit into a 'branch' (to see commits), and then a 'commit' (to see files).. Just like in the local branches view.

- [x] When I do shift+enter while on the commit message body part... It's clearing what I typed instead of doing the same behavior as 'enter'. Weird. Expectation, it behaves like 'enter' as in creates a new line too.

- [x] Another keyboard improvement, when I press 'cmd+v' it doesn't actually paste in 1 frame. It seems to type what I had on my clipboard using the keyboard. so i.e. I pasted something really long, I see it sort of incrementing the text to that point instead of pasting it ' instantly'.

- [x] When Im on '3 Branches'. I want `y` to have an option to 'copy branch name'.

- [x] In '1 Status' I want to see details like
  - repo url (just origin remote, I think)
  - And 'contributors' - whichever is the cheapest way to get that data (i would personally refrain from traversing the entire commits history and get the contirbutors)
  - I want pressing y or o to work here as well.
    - The same ones I get from '3 branches' tab.

- [x] I tried passing a long 'web-1000-read-from-new-something-index-for-something-index' in 'new branch. Ended up having...
      web-1000-read-from-new-someth
      ng-index-for-something-indexi

  I think this is because of text wrapping for textarea inputs. But this is actually very annoying please fix. You feel like there's a better architecture for this maybe? + I feel like the 'text-wrapping' with the `\n` hack right now SHOULD NOT affect the actual output I gave (in case that isnt the behavior yet).. because I know we did essentially a 'hack' to make text inputs wrap the text within the widths of their input boxes with textarea.

  [x] Related: I also noticed, the text wrapping is only applied for when I type or paste. But not resize.
  - [x] Also noticed a major bug related to this... If I resize super small, the program crashes... thread 'main' panicked at (...) index outside of buffer: the area is Rect { x: 0, y: 0, width: 29, height: 38 } but index is (29,13)
        I also noticed for crashes like this (error not relevant ).. It shows the crash message right? But I cant actually stop the program anymore and just looks like whenever I move my mouse that: 35;1;18M35;1;18M35;2;18M35 (basically prints a bunch of those characters in the terminal making it unusable, that I have to close it)
