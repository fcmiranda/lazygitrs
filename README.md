# lazygitrs

A faster, memory-safe, more ergonomic slopfork of lazygit (🦀 rust btw).

This is mostly a "for me" tool — built for my own workflow. Not saying you shouldn't use it, but don't expect it to be a community project. But hey, it works for me!

**Why fork?** PRs were sitting too long, or the upstream direction didn't match how I wanted to work.

The goal: everything lazygit does, but faster and with opinions I actually agree with. (I can't promise backwards-compat w/ lazygit's config since it'll eventually drift w/ my own opinions, but I made sure to do that)

### Install

```sh
npm install -g lazygitrs  # npm
bun install -g lazygitrs  # or bun
cargo binstall lazygitrs  # or cargo-binstall (prebuilt binary, faster)
cargo install lazygitrs   # or cargo (build from source)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blankeos/lazygitrs/main/install.sh | sh # or linux/macos (via curl)
```

Then run:

```sh
lazygitrs
```

### Configuration (`~/.config/lazygitrs/config.yml`)

`lazygitrs` reads config from `~/.config/lazygitrs/config.yml`.
If that file does not exist, it falls back to `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml`.

Example:

```yml
# ~/.config/lazygitrs/config.yml
gui:
  sideBySide:
    # false = no highlighted background for gutter numbers and +/- signs (default)
    highlightGutter: false

git:
  commit:
    # Using claude
    generateCommand: "claude -p 'Generate a conventional commit message for this diff.'"
    # Using opencode
    generateCommand: "opencode run 'Generate a conventional commit message for this diff.'"
    # Using modelcli
    generateCommand: 'DIFF=$(git diff --cached) && modelcli "Generate a conventional commit message for this diff. Always provide a bulletpoint body. $DIFF"'
```

### Build from source (global install)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Blankeos/lazygitrs.git
cd lazygitrs
cargo build --release
sudo install -m 755 target/release/lazygitrs /usr/local/bin/lazygitrs
```

Optional alias if you want to call it as `lazygirts`:

```sh
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/bin/lazygitrs /usr/local/bin/lazygirts
```

### What's different

- [x] **AI commit messages** — works with whatever agent you already use (claude, opencode, codex, or my minimal shim [modelcli](https://github.com/blankeos/modelcli))

- [x] **Side-by-side diffs** with syntax highlighting by default, no pager hacks needed
- [x] **Better diff navigation UX** — `[]` new/old only views, `{}` for hunk traveling, `hjkl←↑↓→` for line-by-line scrolling, supports mouse select/scroll too. Lots inspired by [lumen](https://github.com/jnsahaj/lumen)
- [x] **Default GitHub conveniences** — copy repo url, open repo url, copy PR create url, open PR create, copy pr url, open pr. (The 'copy' variants are useful if you use different default browsers for work/personal.)
- [x] **Branch Filtering** — better experience in the Commits tab, compare what actually matters.
- [x] **Built-in compare tool** — Again, inspired by lumen, but more built into the TUI. Pick a commit/branch A and a commit/branch B, then see how they differ.
- [x] **Interactive rebasing** — inspired by gitlens, a clean and easy-to-use UI for pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, drop and fast rebasing.
- [x] **Commit Details** — Inspired by zed, just a small details panel about the commit that's easier to look at.
- [x] **Command Palette** — easily access stuff like:
  - [ ] `git reset` and then asks, what branch/commit, has quick search.
  - [x] `git diff/compare` and then asks what branch/commit A and B, has quick search.
  - [x] `git rebase` and then asks rebase on top of what branch/commit.
  - [x] 🎨 Themes + Theme-Picker!

### Themes

lazygitrs ships with 30+ built-in color themes (Catppuccin, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Nord, etc.) sourced from [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)'s TUI theme collection.

**Unlike original lazygit, you can switch themes without touching any config file** — just press `?` > **Color Themes** > Enter. Your choice is saved automatically.

**Custom themes:** Drop a `.json` file into `~/.config/lazygit/themes/` and it appears in the picker. Start by copying an existing theme from `src/generated_themes/` and tweaking the colors. The format is a flat JSON with all fields optional (unset values are derived from semantic base colors like `primary`, `success`, `error`):

```json
{
  "id": "my-theme",
  "name": "My Custom Theme",
  "primary": "#ff6600",
  "success": "#00ff88",
  "error": "#ff3333",
  "warning": "#ffcc00",
  "text_strong": "#ffffff",
  "background": "#1a1a2e"
}
```

To refresh the built-in generated themes from OpenCode upstream: `bun run scripts/gen-themes.ts`

### Benchmarks

Startup benchmark using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine):

```sh
Benchmark 1: lazygitrs --version
  Time (mean ± σ):       4.2 ms ±   1.3 ms    [User: 1.2 ms, System: 0.9 ms]
  Range (min … max):     2.7 ms …  15.4 ms    830 runs

Benchmark 2: lazygit --version
  Time (mean ± σ):      13.5 ms ±   2.5 ms    [User: 6.4 ms, System: 5.2 ms]
  Range (min … max):    10.2 ms …  21.2 ms    224 runs

Summary
  lazygitrs --version ran
    3.24 ± 1.16 times faster than lazygit --version
```
