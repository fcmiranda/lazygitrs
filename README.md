# lazygitrs

A slopfork of lazygit, but in rust (🦀 rust btw).

This is mostly a "for me" tool — built for my own workflow. Not saying you shouldn't use it, but don't expect it to be a community project. But hey, it works for me! The goal: everything lazygit does, but faster and with opinions I actually agree with.

**Why fork?** PRs were sitting too long, or the upstream direction didn't match how I wanted to work.

### What's different

- [x] **AI commit messages** — works with whatever agent you already use (claude, opencode, codex, or my minimal shim [modelcli](https://github.com/blankeos/modelcli))
- [x] **Side-by-side diffs** with syntax highlighting by default (shoutout lumen), no pager hacks needed
- [x] **Better diff navigation** — `]`/`[` for hunks, `jk⬆︎⬇︎` for line-by-line scrolling.
- [x] **Default GitHub conveniences** — copy repo url, open repo url, copy PR create url, open PR create, copy pr url, open pr. (The 'copy' variants are useful if you use different default browsers for work/personal.)

### Planned

- [x] commits pane overhaul
  - [x] Better graph view (enabled by default)
  - [x] Filter by branch
  - [x] Filter by commit message (handy if you prefix with ticket IDs)
- [ ] Command palette (OpenCode-style) — still figuring this one out

### Get started

```sh
git clone http://github.com/blankeos/lazygitrs
cd lazygitrs
cargo install --path .
