# lazygitrs

A faster, memory-safe, more ergonomic slopfork of lazygit (🦀 rust btw).

This is mostly a "for me" tool — built for my own workflow. Not saying you shouldn't use it, but don't expect it to be a community project. But hey, it works for me!

**Why fork?** PRs were sitting too long, or the upstream direction didn't match how I wanted to work.

The goal: everything lazygit does, but faster and with opinions I actually agree with. (I can't promise backwards-compat w/ lazygit's config since it'll eventually drift w/ my own opinions, but I made sure to do that)

### Install

> Make sure you have:
>
> - [git](https://git-scm.com)
> - [gh](https://cli.github.com)

```sh
brew install blankeos/tap/lazygitrs # Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
npm install -g lazygitrs            # or npm
bun install -g lazygitrs            # or bun
cargo binstall lazygitrs            # or cargo-binstall (prebuilt binary, faster)
cargo install lazygitrs             # or cargo (build from source)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blankeos/lazygitrs/main/install.sh | sh # or linux/macos (via curl)
```

Then run:

```sh
lazygitrs
```

### What's different

- [x] **AI commit messages** — works with whatever agent you already use (claude, opencode, codex, or my minimal shim [modelcli](https://github.com/blankeos/modelcli)). Set `git.commit.generateCommand` (see [Configuration](#configuration)):

  ```yml
  # ~/.config/lazygitrs/config.yml
  git:
    commit:
      # Using claude
      generateCommand: "claude -p 'Generate a conventional commit message for this diff.' --no-session-persistence"
      # Using opencode
      generateCommand: "opencode run 'Generate a conventional commit message for this diff.'"
      # Using codex
      generateCommand: "codex exec --ephemeral 'Generate a conventional commit message for this diff.'"
      # Using modelcli
      generateCommand: 'DIFF=$(git diff --cached) && modelcli "Generate a conventional commit message for this diff. Always provide a bulletpoint body. $DIFF"'
  ```

- [x] **Side-by-side diffs** with syntax highlighting by default, no pager hacks needed
- [x] **Better diff navigation UX** — `[]` new/old only views, `{}` for hunk traveling, `hjkl←↑↓→` for line-by-line scrolling, supports mouse select/scroll too. Lots inspired by [lumen](https://github.com/jnsahaj/lumen)
- [x] **Default GitHub conveniences** — copy repo url, open repo url, copy PR create url, open PR create, copy pr url, open pr. (The 'copy' variants are useful if you use different default browsers for work/personal.)
- [x] **Branch Filtering** — better experience in the Commits tab, compare what actually matters.
- [x] **Built-in compare tool** — Again, inspired by lumen, but more built into the TUI. Pick a commit/branch A and a commit/branch B, then see how they differ.
- [x] **Interactive rebasing** — inspired by gitlens, a clean and easy-to-use UI for pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, drop and fast rebasing.
- [x] **Commit Details** — Inspired by zed, just a small details panel about the commit that's easier to look at.
- [x] **Command Palette** — easily access stuff like:
  - [ ] `git reset` and then asks, what branch/commit, has quick search.
  - [x] `git diff/compare` and then asks what branch/commit A and B, has quick search.
  - [x] `git rebase` and then asks rebase on top of what branch/commit.
  - [x] 🎨 Themes + Theme-Picker!
- [x] **Universal AI Notes Architecture** — leave review comments on code diffs and instantly notify your AI CLI of choice to review or act on it. `lazygitrs` uses a dynamically registered `.lines.json` session architecture, supporting three transport layers to integrate with *any* AI tool on the market:
  - **Subprocess Spawning** (`notifyCommand`): Spawns a background command (great for `agy`, `claude`, etc.)
  - **HTTP Push** (`serverUrl`): Does an instant HTTP POST to local servers (great for `opencode`)
  - **Server-Sent Events** (`SSE`): Real-time event streaming for wrapper scripts or IDE extensions.

### Configuration

Config goes in `~/.config/lazygitrs/config.yml` or `~/.config/lazygit/config.yml` — both work, using either only won't break anything so you can reference the [original lazygit config guide](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md).

Persisted State lives at `~/.local/state/lazygitrs/state.yml` and `~/.local/state/lazygitrs/commit_message_history` you won't need to touch this.

**New config properties:**

- `git.commit.generateCommand` — shell command for AI-generated commit messages. See [What's different](#whats-different) for examples.
- `gui.border` — can be a string (`rounded`, `single`, `double`, `hidden`) or an object for granular borders:
  ```yaml
  gui:
    border:
      default: hidden
      notes: rounded
      files: rounded
      branches: single
      commits: hidden
      stash: double
      status: rounded
      main: rounded
  ```
  Supported granular components: `notes`, `files`, `branches`, `commits`, `stash`, `status`, `main`, `commandLog`.
- `~/.config/lazygitrs/themes/*.json` — drop custom theme files here. See [Themes](#themes).

### Clearing AI Sessions

If you need to clear or unregister an active AI session for the current repository, you can run the following command:

```sh
PORT=$(cat .lazygitrs.port 2>/dev/null || echo 47657)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/session-api \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"action":"unregister"}'
```

To clear active sessions **globally** across all your repositories (and unregister the currently active one in the directory), you can now simply use the built-in CLI flag:

```sh
lazygitrs --clear-session
```

### Themes

lazygitrs ships with 30+ built-in color themes (Catppuccin, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox, Nord, etc.) sourced from [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)'s TUI theme collection.

**Unlike original lazygit, you can switch themes without touching any config file** — just press `?` > **Color Themes** > Enter. Your choice is saved automatically.

**Custom themes:** Drop a `.json` file into `~/.config/lazygitrs/themes/` and it appears in the picker. Start by copying an existing theme from `src/generated_themes/` and tweaking the colors. The format is a flat JSON with all fields optional (unset values are derived from semantic base colors like `primary`, `success`, `error`):

```json
{
  "id": "my-theme",
  "name": "My Custom Theme",
  "primary": "#ff6600",
  "success": "#00ff88",
  "error": "#ff3333",
  "warning": "#ffcc00",
  "text_strong": "#ffffff",
  "background": "#1a1a2e"
}
```

To refresh the built-in generated themes from OpenCode upstream: `bun run scripts/gen-themes.ts`
